# Real-time Stock Market Data Analysis

This project aims to create an end-to-end data engineering project on real-time stock market data using Kafka.

Python, Amazon Web Services (AWS), Apache Kafka, Glue, Athena, and SQL were used in this project.


Simulated realtime stock market data using Python and using Apache Kafka, enabled real-time streaming and processing of the data.
This real-time data was then consumed and stored in S3. Crawler was used to to create an AWS Glue Data Catalog. The real-time data was then analyzed in Athena.
